# Contractor Portal - Launch Checklist

**Repository:** [kkers42/contractor-portal](https://github.com/kkers42/contractor-portal)
**Target Launch Date:** Monday (Production Deployment to Hostinger)
**Current Status:** Testing Phase on Ubuntu Test Server

---

## Pre-Launch Checklist (MUST DO Before Monday)

### Security & Configuration (Critical)

#### ðŸ”´ Priority 1 - Security Hardening
- [ ] **Generate strong JWT secret** - Replace `APP_JWT_SECRET=CHANGE_ME_IN_PRODUCTION`
  - Command: `openssl rand -base64 64`
  - Update in production `.env` file
  - **Impact:** Without this, JWT tokens can be forged

- [ ] **Rotate database passwords**
  - [ ] Change root MySQL password
  - [ ] Change contractor user password
  - [ ] Update `.env` with new passwords
  - **Impact:** Default passwords are security risk

- [ ] **Disable or change backdoor admin credentials**
  - Option 1: Change password in `.env` (BACKDOOR_ADMIN_PASSWORD)
  - Option 2: Set to empty string to disable
  - Option 3: Remove from `.env` entirely
  - **Impact:** Known default credentials = security vulnerability

- [ ] **Restrict CORS origins** in main.py
  - Currently: `allow_origins=["*"]` (allows ALL domains)
  - Change to: `allow_origins=["https://yourdomain.com"]`
  - **Impact:** Prevents unauthorized API access from other sites

- [ ] **Configure SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt**
  - [ ] Install certbot on Hostinger server
  - [ ] Obtain SSL certificate
  - [ ] Configure nginx/Apache reverse proxy
  - [ ] Update `APP_BASE_URL` in `.env` to use `https://`
  - **Impact:** REQUIRED - passwords sent in plain text without HTTPS

#### ðŸŸ¡ Priority 2 - Environment Configuration
- [ ] **Update database credentials in production `.env`**
  - DB_HOST (if different from 127.0.0.1)
  - DB_USER
  - DB_PASSWORD
  - DB_NAME

- [ ] **Update APP_BASE_URL in production `.env`**
  - Change from `http://localhost:8080` to production domain
  - Example: `https://contractor-portal.yourdomain.com`
  - Used for OAuth callbacks

- [ ] **Configure email settings** (if email features are used)
  - EMAIL_USER
  - EMAIL_PASSWORD
  - Test email sending functionality

### Testing & Verification

  - [ ] Edit property
  - [ ] Delete property
  - [ ] Verify properties show in dropdowns

  - [ ] Report by user (with/without filters)
  - [ ] Verify data accuracy
  - [ ] Test date range filtering

- [ ] **Test role-based access control**

  - [ ] Verify Manager cannot access admin-only pages
  - [ ] Verify User cannot access manager/admin pages
  - [ ] Test 403 errors for unauthorized access

### Database & Deployment

#### ðŸŸ¡ Priority 4 - Database Preparation
- [ ] **Run database migration on production server**
  ```bash
  mysql -u root -p contractor_portal < migrations/2025-10-31_oauth_identities_v2.sql
  ```

- [ ] **Verify database schema**
  - [ ] Check users table has all columns (status, display_name, etc.)
  - [ ] Check identities table exists
  - [ ] Verify indexes are created
  - [ ] Check all foreign keys are valid

- [ ] **Seed initial data** (if needed)
  - [ ] Create first admin user (or rely on backdoor)
  - [ ] Add initial properties
  - [ ] Add landscape products

- [ ] **Set up database backups**
  - [ ] Configure daily automated backups
  - [ ] Test backup restoration process
  - Recommendation: Cron job with mysqldump

#### ðŸŸ¢ Priority 5 - Server Deployment
- [ ] **Clone repository to Hostinger server**
  ```bash
  cd /opt
  git clone https://github.com/kkers42/contractor-portal.git
  cd contractor-portal
  git checkout feature/passwordless-sso
  ```

- [ ] **Set up Python virtual environment**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- [ ] **Create production `.env` file**
  - Copy from `.env.example`
  - Fill in all production values
  - Secure file permissions: `chmod 600 .env`

- [ ] **Configure systemd service**
  - Copy service file from test server or create new
  - Enable service: `sudo systemctl enable contractor-portal`

  - Deployment process

- [ ] **Document admin procedures**
  - How to approve new users
  - How to create/manage users
  - How to access reports

## Overlapping Items (Can Be Done Pre or Post Launch)

These items could be done before launch (if time permits) or after launch (lower priority):

### Can Do Either Time
- [ ] **OAuth configuration** - Works without it, but nice to have
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Security feature, but not blocking
- [ ] **Email notifications** - Nice to have, not critical
- [ ] **Logging improvements** - Useful for debugging, but not required
- [ ] **Monitoring setup** - Important but can be added post-launch
- [ ] **Password complexity** - Security improvement, not blocking

### Recommended Approach
- **Before launch:** Focus on security (JWT secrets, CORS, HTTPS, passwords)
- **After launch:** Focus on features (OAuth, emails, monitoring, UX)

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Must Fix Before Launch)
ðŸ”´ No HTTPS â†’ Passwords sent in plain text
ðŸ”´ Default JWT secret â†’ Tokens can be forged
ðŸ”´ CORS allows all origins â†’ API exposed to any website
ðŸ”´ Backdoor admin with known password â†’ Unauthorized access

### Medium Risk (Should Fix Soon)
ðŸŸ¡ No rate limiting â†’ Vulnerable to brute force
ðŸŸ¡ No audit logging â†’ Can't track suspicious activity
ðŸŸ¡ No monitoring â†’ Won't know if service goes down
ðŸŸ¡ No backups configured â†’ Risk of data loss

### Low Risk (Nice to Have)
ðŸŸ¢ OAuth not configured â†’ Still have password login
ðŸŸ¢ No email notifications â†’ Manual communication works
ðŸŸ¢ Basic UI â†’ Functional but could be prettier
ðŸŸ¢ No mobile optimization â†’ Desktop works fine
